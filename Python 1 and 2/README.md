# Artifact Reflection: Python 1 and 2

## How would I describe this artifact, and what is its purpose?
This artifact is a math game where random questions are given depending on the setting that the user picks. It's purpose is to provide a more entertaining way to challenge users while being productive in enforcing there math skills. 

## In what ways did this artifact contribute to my overall learning experience as a Computer Science major?
This artifact contribute to my overall learning experience as a computer science major by allowing me to work with multiple functions which helped me keep my code more simplified. It also made me think of the users point of view which is the reason why I added a configuration for the game. 
 
## How has this artifact been iteratively developed over time? 
This artifact has been iteratively developed over time because it started out having no settings. It basically was just random numbers and a list of operations which is also randomized, this was the base of the program. Throughout the optimization and rework of the program I've added a difficulty this difficulty determines how much numbers and operation are being in the questions. Then I thought of adding a dynamic progression setting which makes the questions harder the more you get right the easier the more you get wrong.

## what might I have done differently?
I would have hard coded some setting to default or even make more setting so the user can have the freedom to change how they play the game. I would have also added more advance math equations.

## If I were to further develop this artifact, what would I next steps be?
If I were to further to develop this artifact I would make it more visually appealing and fully debug the program.
