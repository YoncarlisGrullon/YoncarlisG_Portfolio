# Artifact Reflection: HTML

This artifact is a basic HTML webpage that provides information about fútbol and some of its players. Its purpose is to showcase my ability to structure and present content using HTML, including organizing information in a readable format. It also serves as a way to combine personal interests with technical learning.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of HTML structure,such as how to use headings, paragraphs, lists, hyper links and more. While simple, it built a strong foundation for more advanced web development.

Initially, the HTML page was just explaining how fútbol was played and its orgins. Over time, I improved it by adding a list of my favorite players in the game. To exclude any type of bias I included evidence like the number of wins they have, goals and how they influenced fútbol as a whole to enforce my favoritism towards them.

If I could do it again, I would have spent more time planning the layout before writing the code.

To develop this further, I would add CSS for a cleaner design and use JavaScript to make the page interactive.
