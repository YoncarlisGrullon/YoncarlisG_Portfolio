# Artifact Reflection: HTML

## How would I describe this artifact, and what is its purpose?
This artifact is a basic HTML webpage that provides information about fútbol and some of its players. Its purpose is to showcase my ability to structure and present content using HTML, including organizing information in a readable format. It also serves as a way to combine personal interests with technical learning.

## In what ways did this artifact contribute to my overall learning experience as a Computer Science major?
This artifact contributes to my overall learning experience as a Computer Science major by strengthening my HTML skills. Expanding my knowledge in web development and overall getting more familiar to the programming language.
 
## How has this artifact been iteratively developed over time? 
Initially, the HTML page was just explaining how fútbol was played and its orgins. Over time, I improved it by adding a list of my favorite players in the game. To exclude any type of bias I included evidence like the number of wins they have, goals and how they influenced fútbol as a whole to enforce my favoritism towards them. 


## what might I have done differently?
If I could do it again, I would have spent more time planning the layout before writing the code. I would also make the information more clear.

## If I were to further develop this artifact, what would I next steps be?
To develop this further, I would create a more cleaner design and make it more interactive for the users.
