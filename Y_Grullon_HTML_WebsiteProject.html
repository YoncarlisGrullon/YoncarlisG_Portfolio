    <h3>The History of Fútbol</h3>
    <p>Fútbol, or soccer, has a long history that dates back to ancient times, with early forms of the game played in China, Greece, Rome, and Mesoamerica. The modern version of the sport began to take shape in 19th-century England, where public schools developed various versions of the game, eventually leading to the formation of the Football Association in 1863, which established the official rules of the game. Soccer spread worldwide through the British Empire and became increasingly popular, with the first international match played in 1872 and FIFA founded in 1904 to oversee global competitions. The first FIFA World Cup was held in 1930, marking the beginning of the sport's premier international tournament. Over time, soccer evolved into the most popular sport in the world, with legendary players like Pelé and Maradona shaping its legacy, while women's soccer has also gained significant traction in recent decades.</p>
