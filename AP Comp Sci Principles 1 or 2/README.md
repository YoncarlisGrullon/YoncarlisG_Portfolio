# Artifact Reflection: AP Comp Sci Principles 1 and 2
[The Program in action](https://yoncarlisgrullon.github.io/Y_Grullon_CMU_SnakeGame.html)

## How would I describe this artifact, and what is its purpose?
This artifact is a remake of a very popular game, snake. Snake is basically a game where the user is a snake and they have to eat apples to grow bigger the amount of apples they eat is equivalent to there points. Its purpose was to see if different shapes can be turned into a game, expressing the creativity of Ap csp.

## In what ways did this artifact contribute to my overall learning experience as a Computer Science major?
This artifact contributed to my overall learning experience as a Computer Science major by helping me learn new attributes.
 
## How has this artifact been iteratively developed over time? 
The project first started as clicker game inspired by cookie clicker. Then I scrapped the idea and started to create a snake game. I first made the basic movements of the snake then overtime I added a the apple which made the snake grow if it collides with it.

## what might I have done differently?
I could have added different game modes or settings.

## If I were to further develop this artifact, what would I next steps be?
If I were to further develop this artifact I would make the snake turn correctly. I would also add more levels, making each level harder to get the apple. Overall making it more challenging.
