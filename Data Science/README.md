# Artifact Reflection: Data Science
[Data Science  Artifact](https://github.com/YoncarlisGrullon/YoncarlisGrullon.github.io/blob/main/GrullonY_DataStoryProject.ipynb)

## How would I describe this artifact, and what is its purpose?
This artifact is data which I analyzed and manipulated to create different graphs to show its connections. The data consisted of the health of people in different U.S county's, the dataset had many columns with different percentages, its purpose was to determine if people with obesity is tethered to being physically inactive. This purpose is to backup any uncertainty with graphs to show people its affect.

## In what ways did this artifact contribute to my overall learning experience as a Computer Science major?
This artifact contributes to my overall learning by increasing my knowledge on what programming can do. I've learned how to break apart and understand data as well as how to graph it. I've also learned many new python libraries which helped me create my program for example, pandas, matplotlib, and NumPy all helped me create Data Frames and learn the basics of data science. 
 
## How has this artifact been iteratively developed over time? 
First the artifact was unfiltered data about the health of people living in different U.S county's. It had many health statistics like % of smokers, % of people who go to college, etc. I decided to pick the % of people with obesity and % of physically inactive from the data frame to compare. I then cleaned the data frame and only left those two columns this is when I created a scatter plot to see its connection. I also create other type of graphs throughout the development of this artifact, the other graphs were scatter and histagraphs.

## what might I have done differently?
I would have added another dataset about the % of genetic obesity throughout the different U.S county's to further prove my point. I could have also used different types of graphs to show each data as well as labeling the data correctly.

## If I were to further develop this artifact, what would I next steps be?
If I were to further develop this artifact, I would make the graphs more visually appealing with seaborn. The current data graph is very messy and unorganized which is why correcting the way its presented will help viewers understand what's being connected. I would also like to add more data sets to show what factor influences obesity the most in the U.S.
